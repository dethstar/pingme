sometimes I will get drowned in emails from a support/ticketing system and I do not know which are related to me
This little tool/script will go through my emails and search for certain terms, keywords like my name or tasks I usually deal with
and send me a tweet/sms or simply a desktop notification with the email subject so I can check it.
